Write a python function that takes 3 integer values, order them from greatest to least, 
using only (if or  if/elif../else ). The output of your program should be in the following format:  3>2>1, 
however you are not allowed to use print() inside the function. You are also not allowed to use 
(if a>b>c: ) 
Hint1: think about nested if
Hint2: this is how we format our strings in python
a=5
print(f”a is {a}”)

Input: a=5,b=-10,c=4 
Output: 5>4>-10

Input: a=15 , b=10 , c=4
Output: 15>10>4

Input: a=5,b=-8,c=14
Output: 14>5>-8

Bonus Question: Try to write the same program this time by only using python built-in functions.
